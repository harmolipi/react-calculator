# Calculator

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/react-calculator).

## Functionality

This is the [Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) project, where I make a calculator in the browser.

## Thoughts

This was a cool project, because it was a return back to my first big project in learning JavaScript, which was also a [Calculator](https://www.github.com/harmolipi/calculator). That one was for me at the time (the budding programmer that I was), a horrid mess of spaghetti code, that only eventually accidentally worked with much tweaking. I remember really not having a good time with it, and indefinitely putting off returning to improve and refactor it.

Well, now I was surprised to see a calculator assignment in freeCodeCamp's curriculum as well, and felt like it was a return to that first big project, now that I'm older and wiser. And indeed, whereas the last one took me a while to finish, I was able to knock this one out in a day. I think what made the difference was the combination between simply knowing some better practices as far as organizing code goes, and also having React at hand, which made working with and updating the UI so much easier.

Anyway, as always, this one can certainly be refactored (primarily to do something about that massive if/else if/else tree in the `Calculator` component), but I'm leaving it for now since it passes the freeCodeCamp tests, and perhaps I'll return to it once more in the future.

God bless.
